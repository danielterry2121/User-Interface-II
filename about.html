  		<h2>Why Hire Me?</h2>
  		<p>	My name is Daniel Terry. I've had an abundance of work experience in many different types of work situations, from customer service, to manufacturing , and 
  		even business. In every job environment I have worked in I have never been fired, I have almost always moved into a solo or leadership role 
  		and been successful in that work-place. I may be new to tech , but I know that I will excel here as-well.</p>
